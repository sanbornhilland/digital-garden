  <h1>Sanborn's Digital Garden</h1>
  <p>
    I'm intrigued by this idea of a <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet">digital garden</a>. Unlike a blog which typically includes fully formed thoughts and well written posts, a digital garden is a working document whose main audience is often the author themselves. It's a place where someone can work out ideas of interest in public. This appeals to me as a method for being more structured in thinking and learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    That said, this idea has appealed to me for a while now and I still don't have a digital garden up and running. Why not? Because every time I think of doing this it spirals out into a list of other questions. "What pages should it have?" "What technology should I use to build it?" "Where should I host it?" And then nothing gets done. A blank canvas is too daunting. In art school I learned that it's often best to just put something down on the canvas. Anything. It could be a line across the middle, or a big circle. The point is, just start and eventually the rest will follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    So that's what this is. I'm marking up the canvas in the most minimal way possible. One "index.html" in a git repo, hosted as a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github page.</a> And in the spirit of a digital garden (and mixed metaphors), we'll see how it grows from here.
